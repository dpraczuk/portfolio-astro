          I’m Darius, an ambitious Frontend Developer striving to become a
          Fullstack one day. I’m passionate about web technologies, always
          trying to keep up with the latest trends to improve my skills (though
          it&apos;s not always easy). I believe that every challenge comes with
          a learning curve. Taking lessons from every new project is what I find
          most interesting about developers job.
          <br />
          <br />
          Throughout my career so far, I&apos;ve had the opportunity to work on maintaining
          websites and enhancing them with additional features, enhancing existing
          project from sports betting industry and developing from scratch e-commerce
          platform for wholesale network from the United States.
          <br />
          <br />
          In breaks from coding, I like to read scientific research in the fields
          of dietetics and motor skills, listen to old-school American hip-hop, go
          running, and follow the latest news from the world of Formula 1 and the
          NBA.
